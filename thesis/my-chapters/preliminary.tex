\section{Preliminary}

In this preliminary chapter, we are going to set the building blocks needed for later chapters without the need of prior knowledge. In all sections of this chapter, every definition will be accompanied by its respective example, and a corresponding illustration for each procedure.

A notion can have all sorts of definition, thus we shall include the citation for every introduced concept.

The structure of this chapter will be as follows: we start by introducing syntax and semantics for our formulas of interest, followed by a transformation of a generic formula in a conjunctive normal form. In plus, we present two proof systems for QBFs and show how an algorithm can solve a QBF. Lastly, we talk about types of format a QBF should be given in to be understood by a solver.
